/// Standalone & Pool Example: The essence of Smart Release
///
/// This example demonstrates the DX improvement in v1.7.0 where developers
/// no longer need to worry about discarding connections — simply calling
/// `release` is enough.
/// After "polluting" a connection with Transaction and Pub/Sub,
/// you can see that a single `release` call cleans it up neatly.
